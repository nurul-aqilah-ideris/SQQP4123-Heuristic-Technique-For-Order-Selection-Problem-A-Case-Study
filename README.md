# Heuristic Technique For Order Selection Problem: A Case Study

## Introduction

This study will solve one of the knapsack applications which is an order selection problem, particularly in the bakery industry. Generally, the items considered in this problem is a list of orders consisting of cakes and cookies, Xj. Each order j will have its sales, Sj, and processing time, Tj. The baker will have a limited time to complete the orders, C. The objective of the problem is to maximize the total sales, Z.  Thus, this study will help the baker to choose which cookies and cakes can be baked in a limited time to maximize the total sales.

## Problem Statement

Bakers usually have tremendous increasing orders during celebrations. Due to limited time, bakers cannot accept all orders from customers. A proper selection needs to be done in order to avoid last-minute cancelation that will give a bad reputation to the bakers. Customersâ€™ satisfaction is also important. Thus, the order must be completed on time. To overcome these issues, this study will apply three heuristic techniques to assist the bakers by proposing which cookies and cakes can be baked within a restricted time and indirectly maximize the total sales of cookies and cakes.

## Research Question

i.	What are the parameters and the constraints involved in this problem?

ii.	How to select orders that can maximize the total sales?

iii.	How to evaluate the quality of the proposed solutions in this study?

iv. What is the suitable sensitivity analysis that suitable for this study?

## Research Objectives

The main objective of this research is to develop a greedy heuristic for solving the order selection knapsack problem.

This study has the following sub-objectives:

i.	To identify parameters and constraints involved in the order selection problem.

ii.	To select orders that can maximize the total sales by using using Integer Programming (IP) Model and heuristic techniques.

iii.  To evaluate the quality of the proposed solutions with a solution by the baker in terms of the total sales.

iv.	To develop sensitivity analysis model related to order selection problem.

## Scope of the Research

This study will be conducted by interviewing only one respondent, who is one of the bakers from Kelantan and has been in this bakery industry for about six years. The data will be collected from the respondent who is required to answer a few questions on how they handle the production of the cookies and cakes ordered by the customers within a limited time, especially for celebrations, to achieve the study's sub-objectives. This study will propose the initial solution by using the three greedy heuristic techniques and the solution is only for one baker.

## Significance of study

i.	To help the bakers to improve the production planning.
    - It will help the bakers to complete orders on time and avoid last minute cancelation.
    
ii.	The heuristic techniques work best to find initial solutions.
    - It will help the bakers to have a scientific approach to solve the order selection problem with the objective is to maximize the total sales.
